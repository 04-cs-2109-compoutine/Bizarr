Bizarr is a collaborative marketplace where all users are able to buy and sell their items.

Bizarr keeps it simple but having everything you would need in a Marketplace in one simple application.

Users can also chat with each other about items in order to discuss any details and finalize their purchases. No more fuss and no more uncertainty about when and where your desired item will be in your hands.
